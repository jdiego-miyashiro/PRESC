# Report output

The report generated by PRESC is built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).
Report source is maintained under [`presc/report`](../presc/report/).

To build the report, run:

```bash
# Hide all the code cells.
# Currently this has to be done by manually adding tags to each notebook cell.
python presc/report/add_tags.py

# Build
jupyter-book build presc/report
```

The rendered report can be viewed at
[`presc/report/_build/html/index.html`](../presc/report/_build/html/index.html).
